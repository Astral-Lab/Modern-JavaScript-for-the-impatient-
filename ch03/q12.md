Depending on the result of Math.random, what is the outcome? When `Math.random() < 0.5` evaluates to true, both function calls to `say` work as expected.
However, when the preceeding statement evaluates to false, `say('Goodbye')` causes an error. Why is this?
Simply put, the `say` function declaration gets hoisted to the top of the function containing it, leaving the defintion inside the if statement. Hence, if the statement evaluates to false, the `say` does not get defined, so when `sat('Goodbye')` is called, the program does not know what to do.

What is the scope of say? The entire file.

When is it initialized? Inside the `if` block.

What happens when you activate strict mode? If `Math.random() < 0.5` evaluates to true, then `say('Goodbye')` does not get called. `'use strict'` limits `says` scope only to inside the if statement.

```javascript
// Coded solution to question 12

/**
 * In sloppy (non-strict) mode, functions can be declared inside a nested
 * block, and they are hoisted to the enclosing function or script. Try out
 * the following example a few times:
 * 
 *  if(Math.random() < 0.5) {
 *      say('Hello')
 *      function say(greeting) { console.log(`${greeting}!`) }
 *  }
 *  say('Goodbye')
 * 
 * Depending on the result of Math.random, what is the outcome? What is the
 * scope of say? When is it initialized? What happens when you active 
 * strict mode?

if(Math.random() < 0.5) {
      say('Hello')
      function say(greeting) { console.log(`${greeting}!`) }
}
say('Goodbye')
```
