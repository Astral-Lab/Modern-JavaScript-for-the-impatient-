// [] + []
console.log([] + [])        // guess: 0, answer: '' (empty string)
                            // Both [] appear to be converted to empty strings,
                            // so [] + [] becomes '' + '' which becomes ''.
                            // The statement console.log(1 + []) evaluates to 1,
                            // using typeof (1 + []) confirms the type string,
                            // hence, [] is converted to an empty string.

// {} + []
console.log({} + [])        // guess: NaN, answer: [object Object]
                            // Using the previous result, we know [] evaluates to '',
                            // this means {} will be converted to a string.
                            // The table on page 11 states when {} is converted to a
                            // string, it evaulates to '[object Object]'.
                            // Hence, the resulting string, [object Object], makes sense.

// [] + {}
console.log([] + {})        // guess: NaN, answer: [object Object]
                            // Refer to the previous explanation.

// {} + {}
console.log({} + {})        // guess: NaN, answer: [object Object][object Object]
                            // The statement typeof ({} + 1) evaluates to [object Object]1,
                            // telling us {} is converted to a string i.e. [object Object].
                            // So, using string concatenation, {} + {} would clearly evaluate
                            // to the string [object, Object][object Object].

// [] - {}
console.log([] - {})        // guess: NaN, answer: NaN
                            // The difference with this statement is the - sign,
                            // meaning only conversion to numbers is attempted.
                            // Hence, [] - {}, is converted to 0 - NaN, which evaluates to NaN.
```
