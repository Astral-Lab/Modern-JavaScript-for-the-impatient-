// Coded solution to question 7

/**
 * 7. Consider this code snippet:
 * 
 *      let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]
 *      for(i in arr) { if (i + 1 === 10) console.log(arr[i]) }
 * 
 * Why doesn't is print anything?
 */

// The 'i' variable in the '(i + 1 === 10)' statement is a string, so 'i + 1' becomes a string,
// and since we're using the strict equality operator, '===', the if statement never evaulates
// to true, so nothing gets printed.

// Correct implementation:
 let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12];
 for(i in arr) { if (parseInt(i) + 1 === 10) console.log(arr[i]) }
 ```
