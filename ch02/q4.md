// Coded solution to question 4

/**
 * 4. What are the results of comparing undefined, null, 0, and '' values with the
 * operators < <= ==? Why?
 */

// <                                
/**
 * If one operand is a number, the other operand is converted to a number.
 * 
 * Hence, any inequality involving 0 will be false, as 0 < 0 is always false.
 * 
 * If both operands are strings, compare them as strings.
 * 
 * Otherwise, convert non-numeric types to numeric values:
 * 
 *  * true/false becomes 1/0
 * 
 *  * null becomes 0
 * 
 *  * undefined becomes NaN
 * 
 *  * strings become numbers if of the form '3' etc or NaN otherwise 'hello'
 * 
 * Hence, any inequality invloving undefined, will be false.

console.log(undefined < null);      // guess: false, answer: false. See explanation above.

console.log(null < undefined);      // guess: false, answer: false. See explanation above.

console.log(null < '');             // guess: false, answer: false. null and '' are converted to 0, 0 < 0 is false.

console.log(undefined < 0);         // guess: false, answer: false. See explanation above.

console.log(null < 0);              // guess: false, answer: false. See explanation above.

console.log(0 < '');                // guess: false, answer: false. See explanation above.

console.log();

// <=

console.log(undefined <= null);     // guess: true, answer: false. undefined becomes NaN, any inequality involving NaN is false.

console.log(null <= undefined);     // guess: false, answer: false. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^.

console.log(0 <= null);             // guess: true, answer: true. null becomes 0, 0 <= 0 is true.

console.log(undefined <= '');       // guess: false, answer: false. undefined becomes NaN, any inquality involving NaN is false.

console.log();

// ==

console.log(undefined == null);     // guess: true, answer: true. undefined and null are loosely related, so the equality holds true.

console.log(0 == '');               // guess: true, answer: true. '' is converted to a number (0), so the equality holds true.

console.log(0 == undefined);        // guess: false, answer: false. undefined is loosely related to null, but no other values. 

console.log('' == null);            // guess: false, answer: false. See above explanation.
