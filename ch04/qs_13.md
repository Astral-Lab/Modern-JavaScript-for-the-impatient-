 * 13. In Section 4.12, "The this Reference" (page 92), you saw that the following
 * doesn't work:
 * 
 *  const action = BankAccount.prototype.deposit
 *  action(1000)
 * 
 * Can you make it work by getting the action method from an instance, 
 * like this:
 * 
 *  const harrysAccount = new BankAccount()
 *  const action = harrysAccount.deposit
 *  action(1000)
 * 
 * Why or why not?
 * 
 * No. It does not work. The reason is methods are stored in the class
 * prototype, so 'this' is still undefined. 
 * 
 * 'const action = harrysAccount.deposit' is equivalent to 'const action = BankAccount.prototype.deposit',
 * as the first statement cannot find the 'deposit' method in the harryAccount object, so it looks for it
 * in the prototype. Whereas, the second statement accesses the BankAccount prototype directly.

const harrysAccount = new BankAccount()
