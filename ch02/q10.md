```javascript
// Coded solution to question 10

/**
 * 10. Rewrite the do loop in Section 2.9, "while and do Loops" (page 40), as a 
 * while loop.
 */

let s = 'Hello World!';                     // To avoid 's is not defined'

// original do loop:

let i = 0;

do {
    i++;
} while (i < s.length && s[i] != ' ');

// as a while loop:

let j = 0;                              

while(j < s.length && s[j] != ' ') {        // I am assuming the question asks for an implementation where no data is processed before entering the loop.
    j++;
}
```
