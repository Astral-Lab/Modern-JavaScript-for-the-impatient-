// Coded solution to question 4

/**
 * 4. Suppose angle is some angle in degrees that, after adding or subtracting
 * other angles, has assumed an arbitrary value. You want to normalize it
 * so that it is between 0 (inclusive) and 360 (exclusive). How do you do
 * that with the % operator?
 */

let angles = [0, 18, 187, 360, 361, 1080, 20038, -30, -1, -360, -361, -729];

function normalizeAngle(angle) { return angle % 360; }

for(let angle of angles) {
    console.log(normalizeAngle(angle));
}
