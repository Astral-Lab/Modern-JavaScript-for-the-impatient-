/**
 * 11. Make a couple of objects representing people and store them in variables
 * harry and sally. To each person, add a property friends that contains an
 * array with their best friends. Suppose harry is a friend of sally and sally
 * is a friend of harry. What happens when you log each object? What 
 * happens when you call JSON.stringify?
 */

const harry = {
    age: 23,
    friends: ['Johnny', 'Alex', 'Taylor', 'Sallly'],
    favouriteMovie: 'The Batman'
}

const sally = {
    age: 22,
    friends: ['Harry', 'Alice'],
    favouriteMovie: 'Avengers Endgame'
}

// What happens when you log each object?

// From the console output, we can see that the object is output exactly as it is defined.

console.log(harry)

console.log(sally)

// What happens when you call JSON.stringify?

// From the console output, we can see thay all property names are enclosed in double quotes and all array values are enclosed in double quotes.

console.log(JSON.stringify(harry))

console.log(JSON.stringify(sally))
