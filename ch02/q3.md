// Coded solution to question 3

/**
 * 3. Consider the statement
 * 
 *      let x = a
 * 
 *    What tokens could start the next line that prevent a semicolon to be
 *    inserted? Which ones can realistically occur in an actual program?
 */

// What tokens could start the next line that prevent a semicolon to be inserted?

// example 1

let x = a
+ 1

// example 2

let y = a
* 3 + 2 - 1

// example 3

let z = a
(console.log("Hello Function!"))

// Which ones can realistically occur in an actual program?

// Answer: example 1 and 2. Where a variable definition has an rvalue which consists of many expressions, 
// it would make sense to span the rvalue across multiple lines to improve readability.
```
